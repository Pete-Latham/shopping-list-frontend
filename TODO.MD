# Things to do

- [x] Add look ahead search when adding items to a shopping list

- [x] Sort out item sorting when ticking items off

- [x] Add auth flows

- [x] Will we have issues with users disappearing when migrations are run because of the table being dropped? Do we need to protect this table or its data?

- [x] Add Infisical for secrets management

- [x] Have we got JWT refresh?

- [x] Webhooks for list updates

- [ ] Secret timing issue - WebSocket gateway and auth service getting different secrets from Infisical
- [ ] Caching issue - Infisical config service caching old secrets
- [ ] Environment mismatch - Different environments or projects being accessed
